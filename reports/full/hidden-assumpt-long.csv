Pro-Russian Unrest in Ukraine;War in Donbass;,Kremlin opponents based in Ukraine are planning how they can to topple Putin,"“Who asked for a selfie with Adam?” Amina Okuyeva wrote on Facebook last month, next to a picture of her with husband Adam Osmayev.","Now opponents of the Kremlin’s increasingly authoritarian rule – from Chechen rebels to veteran liberal activists – are not only drawing inspiration from Ukraine but making the war-ravaged, near-bankrupt state the base from which they hope to topple Putin’s regime.",,"Osmayev joined an “international peacekeeping battalion” founded by Isa Munayev, who was a military leader in Chechnya during de-facto independence in the late 1990s, before Putin reasserted Moscow’s control over the region with a second war in a decade.","Munayev arrived in Ukraine this year from Denmark, where he heads a Chechen diaspora group.",His battalion includes dozens of Chechens as well as other foreigners and Ukrainians.,"“But this isn’t just a military effort,” Okuyeva said, wearing a camouflage headscarf and sipping tea in a café in Kiev, during leave from the front line.","“In Ukraine we can create an information platform, because the media is free.",We can say what we like and be heard.,In Russia it’s impossible to have such a platform – from here we can tell the whole world what is happening in Russia.”,"As Putin’s allies continue to turn the screw on media, civil society and political groups that criticise him, so Okuyeva expects more Russian dissidents to move to Ukraine.","Olga Kurnosova, a familiar face and strident voice at Russian opposition rallies for more than a decade, is already here.","“It’s basically just an ordinary, everyday photo.”","She arrived in Ukraine from Moscow in October, having been warned by a trusted contact that Russian police were planning to arrest and frame her on some trumped-up charge.","She grabbed a few essentials, told friends on a phone she thought was bugged that she was leaving for St Petersburg, and instead travelled by minibus to Belarus.","At Minsk airport she waited until the last possible moment to buy a ticket for fear she would be stopped from leaving, then boarded a flight for Kiev.","“I held my breath until that plane took off,” she said.","Kurnosova was arrested countless times at protest rallies in Russia, spending many nights in police cells, since the days 20 years ago when she was on St Petersburg city council and Putin worked in the mayor’s office.","He was such a “dull, insignificant” figure that she has few strong memories of the man whose regime she accuses of driving her from homeland, along with more than 100 other Kremlin critics whom she said have recently relocated from Russia to Ukraine.","“It’s impossible to change things in Russia through elections now and by taking part you are only legitimising the corrupt system,” Kurnosova said.","“We should form an opposition abroad, linking groups in Ukraine with Russian communities in places like the Baltic states and Moldova so that, when the time comes, we have a transparent, functioning system to put in place [in Russia].”","Kurnosova sets no store by Putin’s huge approval ratings, saying most Russians dare to give pollsters only “politically correct” answers.",She thinks the country’s elite could turn on the president if his policies expose them to sustained financial pain.,"But the snapshot, like the couple’s life, is somewhat unusual.",“There is a feeling of panic in the elite already.,"They have no ideology – it’s all about money – and if they think they could keep their wealth by getting rid of Putin, they might do it.","“If they alter their trajectory, it may be possible to change Russia without bloodshed,” Kurnosova added, “but I only give that a 5 per cent chance.”","For Kurnosova, like most of her compatriots and for world leaders, the idea of Russia collapsing into bloody chaos is the stuff of nightmares.","For the 250,000 or so Chechens now living abroad after fleeing war with Russia, however, such a scenario may seem like the only way to finally win independence and return home.","“The last war of the Russian empire is happening here in Ukraine, which is an outpost or a fortress of European civilisation against Russia,” Okuyeva said.","“When Russia loses, it will break up, and the Urals, Siberia and Chechnya and the North Caucasus will be free.”","On the front line, Osmayev said “thousands” of Chechens in Europe would fight for Ukraine if Kiev legalised their status and gave them citizenship.","For now, Okuyeva added, most of the Chechens on Ukraine’s side are acting as advisers to the country’s military and volunteer battalions.","The separatists in eastern Ukraine have their own warriors from Chechnya, loyal to its Kremlin-backed warlord Ramzan Kadyrov, including a “death battalion” with orders to capture or kill Chechens fighting for Kiev.","Clad in camouflage and carrying Kalashnikovs and grenade launchers, Osmayev and Okuyeva are pictured somewhere in eastern Ukraine, where they are among a growing number of Chechens now fighting Russian-backed separatists.","“We see messages online saying they are looking for us and we have information that they are active here,” Osmayev said, confirming that enemies from Russia’s bloodiest domestic conflict were now hunting each other in eastern Ukraine.","“We are looking for them too,” he added.",“We are trying to make sure we get them first.”,,,,,,,,"Moreover, the photo was taken just days after Osmayev’s release from jail in Odessa, where

leaving “DPR”-controlled Donetsk city travelling freely through the “DPR” checkpoint in a southern direction.","The SMM also observed in Donetsk city five cargo trucks escorted by a “DPR” “military police” vehicle, moving west.","In government-controlled Marinka (23km south-west of Donetsk) the SMM talked to several interlocutors, who expressed a strong opinion about the need for Ukrainian Armed Forces to open a passage across the contact line for the residents from the nearby villages to travel on the Kurakhove-Donetsk route.","Following that the SMM discussed the issue with the civil-military co-operation officers of the Ukrainian Armed Forces in Marinka, who stated the Anti-Terrorist Operation Headquarters was considering the idea of opening the requested passage

Heorhiivka (26km south-west of Donetsk) confirmed to the SMM that local businesses indeed had to obtain a permit in order to transport goods through the checkpoint.,On 26 September the SMM observed long lines of civilian vehicles at armed checkpoints waiting to cross both into governmental-controlled and “DPR”-controlled areas.,While driving on H20 highway the SMM recorded at a Ukrainian Armed Forces checkpoint near Berezove (31km south-west of Donetsk) a queue of 160 vehicles waiting to cross into government-controlled area.,"Approaching a government checkpoint near government-controlled Volnovakha (52km south-west of Donetsk) the SMM noted 90 vehicles waiting to cross into the governmental-controlled area, and 432 vehicles queued to move north, into the “DPR”-controlled area.",The situation remained largely calm in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions with only sparse ceasefire violations recorded by the SMM.,"At a checkpoint near government-controlled Maiorsk (44km north of Donetsk) the SMM counted 370 vehicles waiting to enter the government-controlled area, while 16 buses, 300 pedestrians, and 30 vehicles were queued to enter the “DPR”-controlled area.",At the government checkpoint near Zaitseve (50km north-east of Donetsk) the SMM observed at least 79 vehicles waiting to move into the “DPR”-controlled area and 373 vehicles waiting to travel into the

increased by an average 5% during the month of September.,The SMM interlocutors at the markets claimed that the rise in prices was owed to the fact that they had to pay at the checkpoints for transporting the supplies into “LPR”-controlled areas.,"The SMM observed that the Russian Rouble was used as the primary currency in the market transactions, rather than the Ukrainian Hryvnia.","The SMM monitored on 26 September a local ceasefire regime, through which it facilitated power line repair works near “LPR”-controlled Obozne (18km north of Luhansk).",The SMM heard two explosions occurring within an interval of three hours.,"A repair worker of the electrical company informed the SMM that a member of the “LPR” demining team had been injured by an anti-personnel mine in the

missing, as they had been during the previous visit on 5 April (see SMM Daily Report 7 April ).","The SMM visited on the same day two Ukrainian Armed Forces heavy weapons holding areas, which were found empty.","The SMM had previously recorded eight self-propelled howitzers (2S3 Akatsiya , 152mm) at one site and four self-propelled howitzers (2S1) at the second.",The military commander present at the first site told the SMM that the weapons were redeployed to another specified location on the previous day.,At the second site the SMM learned from several civilian interlocutors that the military removed the weapons from the site a few days prior to the visit.,"In violation of the respective withdrawal lines, the SMM unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) spotted 11 tanks (type unknown) in the area of “DPR”-controlled Sontseve (56km south-east of Donetsk).","At the Joint Centre for Control and Co-ordination (JCCC) observation point at “Donetsk People’s Republic” (“DPR”)-controlled Donetsk

tanks (type unknown) at the training area in “LPR”-controlled Kruhlyk (31km south-west of Luhansk).,"A day earlier the SMM spotted at the same training area one heavy multiple launch thermobaric rocket system (TOS-1 Buratino , 220mm).","In the area of government-controlled Novookhtyrka (53km north-west of Luhansk)  the SMM noted a convoy consisting of three main battle tanks (T-72) transported on trailers, and one infantry fighting vehicle (IFV, BMP-2) moving east.","On 27 September the SMM noted a military convoy in the area of government-controlled Artemivsk (66km north-east of Donetsk), which contained six self-propelled howitzers (2S1), one armoured personnel carrier (APC), and one military truck transporting troops to a north-west direction.","Also on 27 September the SMM observed another convoy consisting of four IFVs (BMP), and three towed howitzers (D-30) moving north away from Artemivsk on the M03 highway.","On 27 September the SMM noted a convoy of six tracked APCs (type unknown) moving east, in the area of government-controlled Plotyna (28km north-east of Luhansk).","On the same day the SMM observed at the training area near “LPR”-controlled Uspenka (23km south-west of Luhansk) a number of heavy artillery pieces, including 12 towed howitzers (D-30, 122mm), and 13 self-propelled howitzers (2S1), an increase comparing to previous SMM observation (see SMM Daily Report 25 September ).",[1] The Ukrainian Armed Forces representatives at the JCCC present at the observation point suggested the explosions were likely part of “DPR” training activities.,"The SMM continued to monitor the situation at the crossing points to Crimea – Kalanchak, Chaplynka, and Chonhar (95, 90, and 162km south-east of Kherson , respectively) – which remained relatively calm and stable.","Activists randomly checked vehicles and drivers’ documents at their improvised check-points, which are now installed a few kilometres away from the three Ukrainian border guards crossing points.","At the activists’ improvised checkpoint some 2km away from the Kalanchak crossing point, a protester who introduced herself as the Pravyi Sektor’s Press Officer told the SMM that the vehicle drivers and passengers did not object to car searches when approached by activists, and “showed their understanding of the blockade”.","At Chonhar, another Pravyi Sektor activist told the SMM on 27 September that less than a quarter of the drivers passing the ‘blockade’ were contesting the activists’ efforts to conduct vehicle searches.",On 27 September the SMM followed up with the Odessa Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) and the Odessa regional police on the explosion that occurred at the headquarters of the Odessa SBU office earlier the same day.,The police confirmed that an unidentified explosive device in the equivalent of at least 5 kg of trinitrotoluene (TNT) had been placed near the back door of the SBU building and exploded at 04:45hrs.,"The SBU interlocutor told the SMM that nobody had been injured in the detonation, and that an investigation had been initiated under the “terrorism” article of Ukraine’s Criminal Code.","The SMM continued to monitor the situation in Kharkiv , Dnepropetrovsk , Chernivtsi , Ivano-Frankivsk , Lviv and Kyiv .","*Restrictions on SMM monitoring, access and freedom of movement:","The SMM is restrained in fulfilling its monitoring functions by restrictions imposed by the parties and security considerations, including mine threats, and damaged infrastructure.","On 27 September the SMM heard six explosions consistent with outgoing mortar or artillery fire, as well as small-arms and heavy-machine-gun fire some 1.5-2km east of its position at a filling station in government-controlled Opytne (61km north-east of Donetsk).",The security situation in Donbas is fluid and unpredictable and the ceasefire does not hold everywhere.,"Self-imposed restrictions on movement into high-risk areas have impinged on SMM patrolling activities, particularly in some areas not controlled by the government.",Members of the “LPR” continue to prevent the SMM from monitoring in some areas close to the border with the Russian Federation .,"Denied access: On 26 September the armed personnel at a “DPR” “traffic police” checkpoint stopped the SMM some 2km away from the Ternove shooting range, denying its passage without any explanation; On 27 September two “LPR” “border guards” stopped the SMM in “LPR”-controlled Velykyi Sukhodil (43km south-east of Luhansk), a town 1.5km away from the Ukraine-Russian Federation

town.","Delayed access: During the visit of a “DPR” heavy weapons holding area on 26 September, the SMM was not allowed access to the site for 50 minutes, until the “DPR” guard received a phone call from his superior; The “DPR” armed members at a checkpoint near Ozeryanivka (32km north-east of Donetsk) delayed the SMM for 75 minutes, after which it only allowed its movement with an escort.","Interference with the UAV: On 27 September, while flying over “DPR”-controlled areas north-east of government-controlled Mariupol (103km south-west of Donestk) a SMM UAV was jammed four

with outgoing mortar or artillery fire, as well as small-arms and heavy-machine-gun fire some 1.5-2km east of its position at a filling station in government-controlled Opytne (61km north-east of

leaving “DPR”-controlled Donetsk city travelling freely through the “DPR” checkpoint in a southern direction.","The SMM also observed in Donetsk city five cargo trucks escorted by a “DPR” “military police” vehicle, moving west.","In government-controlled Marinka (23km south-west of Donetsk) the SMM talked to several interlocutors, who expressed a strong opinion about the need for Ukrainian Armed Forces to open a passage across the contact line for the residents from the nearby villages to travel on the Kurakhove-Donetsk route.","Following that the SMM discussed the issue with the civil-military co-operation officers of the Ukrainian Armed Forces in Marinka, who stated the Anti-Terrorist Operation Headquarters was considering the idea of opening the requested passage corridor.","The SMM spoke to shop-owners in government-controlled Krasnohorivka (21km west of Donetsk) who indicated that they had to acquire from the city administration a permit with the list of products they were bringing through government checkpoints, and that there was a limit for the amount of goods per crossing.",The deputy commander at the closest relevant government checkpoint near Heorhiivka (26km south-west of Donetsk) confirmed to the SMM that local businesses indeed had to obtain a permit in order to transport goods through the checkpoint.,On 26 September the SMM observed long lines of civilian vehicles at armed checkpoints waiting to cross both into governmental-controlled and “DPR”-controlled areas.,While driving on H20 highway the SMM recorded at a Ukrainian Armed

Federation Krasnodar region licence plates.",The licence plate number was fixed on a factory-made frame carrying the Russian inscription “FSB of Russian Federation”.,"As the SMM was about to depart from the facility, a male wearing the Russian new-style camouflage uniform without  any rank, insignia or patches, came out of the resort building and took a photograph or video of the leaving SMM vehicle, and made written notes.",The SMM observed an overall calm security situation in the Luhansk region with few ceasefire violations.,"On 26 September, from a stationary position north of government-controlled Trokhizbenka (33km north-west of Luhansk), the SMM heard in short intervals a couple of small-arms shots, three undetermined explosions, and sounds of two outgoing 82mm mortar rounds.","All sounds were assessed as originating from the nearby Ukrainian Armed Forces military training area, and the SMM was informed in advance by Ukrainian Armed Forces that live-fire exercises

increased by an average 5% during the month of September.,The SMM interlocutors at the markets claimed that the rise in prices was owed to the fact that they had to pay at the checkpoints for transporting the supplies into “LPR”-controlled areas.,"The SMM observed that the Russian Rouble was used as the primary currency in the market transactions, rather than the Ukrainian Hryvnia.","The SMM monitored on 26 September a local ceasefire regime, through which it facilitated power line repair works near “LPR”-controlled Obozne (18km north of Luhansk).",The SMM heard two explosions occurring within an interval of three hours.,"A repair worker of the electrical company informed the SMM that a member of the “LPR” demining team had been injured by an anti-personnel mine in the

during the demining process that preceded the repairs.",The SMM re-visited on 26 September three “DPR” heavy weapons holding areas.,"The SMM recorded a small number of ceasefire violations in the Donetsk region, where the security situation was otherwise relatively calm.","At one of the sites the “DPR” armed member on guard did not allow access to the SMM for 50 minutes, until receiving

military removed the weapons from the site a few days prior to the visit.,"In violation of the respective withdrawal lines, the SMM unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) spotted 11 tanks (type unknown) in the

They were thrown into prison.","Meanwhile, nationalist groups did not surrender their weapons, but threatened to use force in the eastern regions.","In response, people in the east started arming themselves.","Refusing to see that something was badly wrong in the Ukrainian state and to start a dialogue, the government threatened to use military force and even sent tanks and aircraft against civilians.",It was one more serious crime committed by the current Kiev rulers.,"I hope that they will see that they are moving into a deep hole, and that they are pulling their country along.","In this sense, the talks that will start today in Geneva are very important, because I believe that we should get together to think about ways out of this crisis and to offer people a real, not sham, dialogue.",There were also a few personal questions.,"The current Kiev authorities have travelled to the eastern regions, but who do they talk to there? They talk to their appointees.","There’s no need to go to Donbass for this, because they can summon them to Kiev for a meeting.","They should talk with people and with their real representatives, with those whom people trust.","They should release the arrested [opponents], help people to express their opinion in an organised manner, suggest new leaders and start a dialogue.","People in the eastern regions are talking about federalisation, and Kiev has at long last started talking about de-centralisation.","But what do they mean?

invasion of Crimea, Russia counted on two key factors to minimise the risk of bloodshed among its own forces and maximise the chances for success: (1) A brand new Ukrainian central government in disarray; and (2) No prospect for a military response by NATO.",How would Estonia have fared in a similar situation?,"If we put Estonia in the same place as Ukraine, what would have been Estonia’s chances of adequately responding?","Above all, an attack would, similarly to Crimea, focus on airfields and harbours that would make it possible to rapidly deploy additional forces into Estonia, as well as on local government institutions, which would have more of a political role.","Unlike Crimea, forces can also be deployed and fanned out across the country using the southeastern Estonian road network.","Given the events in Crimea, we can of course only concur with the planners, but do the core elements of Estonia’s military national defence system meet the current needs?",The mobilisable reserve forces form the main bulwark of Estonia’s military defences.,The primary role of the Estonian Defence Forces in peacetime is to prepare reserve units by training conscripts and reservists.,Less emphasis is laid on training professional units and sub-units manned by members of the voluntary defence organisation Kaitseliit .,"In Estonia, conscription is currently organised as a training cycle repeated at regular intervals.",Units manned by conscripts that have completed their training cycle do not remain on active duty.,Conscripts are assigned to the reserves and sent home.,"To this point, it has been considered a sound practice because since the 1990s, the Russian armed forces have been considered to have their hands full dealing with internal problems.","Thus Estonian defence planners assumed that the security environment would deteriorate only gradually, allowing the country’s political and military leaders time to calmly prepare and procure more ammunition, mobilise reserve units and carry out additional training.",Today it is obvious that the general security situation has grown significantly worse.,"Should a Crimea scenario arise, the Estonian Defence Forces would not have time to mobilise reserve units.",Rapid action by the forces of the Russian Federation,"Moreover, there would be no point in pitting conscripts with only limited training against Russian special forces who would already have seized and taken up defence of sites of strategic importance.","If we analyse the dates when conscripts are called up for compulsory military service in 2014 and the number of conscripts, we see that only in the first five months of the year there are significant number of conscripts who would be capable of operating at least on a platoon level.","The Defence Forces also have a smaller contingent consisting of rapid-response units (above all, the Scouts Battalion and also a special operations unit) manned with active duty personnel.","In recent years Kaitseliit has increased its membership at a stable pace and as of the end of 2012, the organisation had around 13,200 active members.","Yet caution should be exercised in using this number, because all active members do not belong to units that have trained together, although their commitment to defend their country can be assumed to be high.","According to the new national defence development plan, Estonia’s military defence capacity will grow significantly in the decade ahead.","Larger numbers, however, do not necessarily ensure sufficient security in a situation where a highly capable enemy is acting decisively.",An attacker may intentionally sow doubts as to whether the country has fallen victim to aggression or whether it is merely a criminal group that has managed to occupy a building.,"This “fog” may cause mobilisation to be put off so long that the adversary could occupy key sites and thereby make mobilisation difficult, if not impossible.",The deployment of allied forces to Estonia before or during a possible military attack is one of the most important aspects of NATO membership.,It took very little time for the forces of the Russian Federation to occupy strategic sites in Crimea.,"The main value of belonging to the alliance lies in military deterrence through all members’ commitment to collective defines under Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty, which should lead potential adversaries to abandon the idea of military aggression in the first place.","But if a Crimea-type, “creeping” invasion scenario involving special forces should come to pass, Estonia would have very limited immediate support from the allied units.","The NATO Air Policing Mission, even with its recent strengthening in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, would offer primarily symbolic support.","The key deterrent is therefore deployment of NATO ground troops to Estonia – either permanently or by prepositioning equipment, allowing the units’ personnel to be deployed relatively quickly if a crisis develops.",A new aspect seen with regard to Russia is its ability to incite revolts and unrest on foreign soil while rapidly deploying military forces to aggravate and exploit the resultant political turmoil.,The question is about what measures Estonia could implement to allow it to respond immediately and forcefully to military aggression.,"On the national level, the transition from peacetime to wartime must be seamless and ensure continuity of leadership.",Command exercises must be regularly held for Estonia’s political and military leaders.,"The responsibility of every government agency should, as a crisis deepens, remain as little changed as possible, without complex and risky transitions.",The simplest and most logical move is to base all activities that take place across all agencies in both peacetime and wartime on a uniform set of principles.,"At 4:00 AM on 27 February 2014, Russia’s president Vladimir Putin gave the order to launch an exercise on the Black Sea involving 36 ships and 7,000 troops.","Estonia will always be unable to win a war of sheer numbers against its eastern neighbour, so it must focus on quality.","This will require units in a high state of readiness, fully manned, well trained and equipped.",The question facing Estonian defines planners is therefore whether the Defence Forces in the future should focus on reserves or on ensuring the existence of highly capable units that can be used immediately.,The events in Crimea show that the latter should be a priority.,"Undoubtedly radical measures should be considered, such as increasing the number of units manned with active duty personnel.",Another possibility is to extend the duration of conscription so that the units that are trained during compulsory military service are not immediately assigned to the reserves but instead left on active duty for a time.,"This is the option being explored in Norway, where an 18-month term of service is being attempted that would allow conscripts to be used for up to six months.","Kaitseliit , too, should include sub-units at a high state of readiness, with a training level and equipment that allows them to be used against an opponent’s elite units.","In parallel to Estonia’s efforts, its NATO allies should be asked to increase its presence in the Baltic States, one that goes beyond NATO’s current Air Policing Mission.","In the light of Russia’s aggression against Georgia and Ukraine, the lack of a NATO military presence in a state neighbouring Russia appears to provide an incentive for Moscow to consider using force to pursue political objectives.",In the hour that followed – starting around 4:00 AM local time – about 30-50 Russian special forces members entered and occupied the parliament and government buildings of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea.,"Thus, the permanent stationing of NATO ground units and/or prepositioning of equipment in some of the Baltic States could be of critical importance to deterring potential aggressors in coming months and years.",,,,,,,,,,There should have been a swift response to the developments in Crimea.,,,,,,,,,,,"Indeed, had the Ukrainian leadership acted rapidly and forcefully, utilising the forces at its disposal, the advances made by Russian special forces could have been

been more creative, with state media vilifying the Ukrainian army and authorities with zeal and inventiveness.","The most notorious example came in July, when state-run Channel One said Ukrainian

Research Institute of World Economy and International Relations of the Russian Academy of Sciences (IMEMO).","I welcome prominent researchers, statesmen, politicians and diplomats from Russia and other countries, who are attending this forum.","Regrettably, the world has not become more stable or predictable.",,"We more than once pointed to the reasons for deterioration in the international situation, the frailty of the unipolar world concept, counterproductive unilateral actions and the risks entailed in undermining international law and the associated growth in the use of force in international affairs.","It has become obvious that the liberal model of globalisation, which was developed in the early 1990s, primarily its economic element that is designed to secure leadership for a small group of countries at the expense of the rest of the world, has exhausted its potential.","Despite the seemingly noble goals, this model turned out to be vulnerable to various challenges and incapable of dealing with numerous problems.",Additional opportunities that opened up for mankind in connection with the transition to a new industrial and technological level have failed to narrow the development gap between the rich and the poor countries.,It has in fact increased over the past several decades.,The world economy and world finances remain volatile.,Climate change is fraught with major risks.,"Poverty, social vulnerability and sharpening competition in virtually every area are promoting isolationism, protectionism, nationalism, extremism and uncontrolled migration.","The reverse side of the “West-centric” globalisation model, the persistent desire to measure others by one’s own pseudo-liberal values, impose changes from the outside with no consideration for local traditions and even use force to remove undesirable regimes, has been a surge in international terrorism.",Combined intellectual efforts and an expert and depoliticised search for the best way to deal with the current problems in this complicated situation deserve our respect and support.,"In turn, nonstop bloody terrorist attacks in various parts of the world and the migration crisis that has hit Europe prove that attempts to build “individual islets of security,” sit it out in a “safe harbour” or address one’s own problems without relying on broad international cooperation are illusive.",The massive growth of cyber crime and the more frequent use of information and communications technologies to influence the socio-political and socio-economic situation and manipulate public opinion for the sake of narrow mercenary goals arouse special concern.,The propaganda of extremist ideas and recruitment of young people to international terrorist organisations in cyber space is no less dangerous.,"For years, Russia has persistently called for the adoption of universal rules for the responsible behaviour of states in cyber space under UN aegis.",We are expecting a response to our proposals.,"Evidently, in the foreseeable future, the world will continue facing a number of long-term problems of a truly pan-civilisational nature.","President Vladimir Putin, addressing the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum not long ago, pointed out that we must not, have no right to, waste our efforts and time on squabbles, feuds and geopolitical games.","What we need is wise and balanced approaches, without stakes on unilateral global domination and the vicious practice of “double standards.”","Today, we are all participants of an objective process of forming a polycentric world order, which Yevgeny Primakov spoke and wrote a lot about.",His talent as a researcher and a genuinely systematic approach made it possible to focus on the most important thing and to grasp the meaning of tectonic shifts in the international arena.,"The Foreign Ministry appreciates the Primakov Readings’ focus on dealing with current issues based on the experience of our famous predecessors, including the diverse heritage of Yevgeny Primakov.",Hardly anyone can dispute that this is a natural trend which has taken shape in the wake of the realignment of the global balance of power and the strengthening of the factor of cultural and civilisational identity in the modern world.,"It is in our common interest not to restrain this process, but to ensure its stability and predictability, and to make sure that the renewed world order ‒ cleaned on the basis of the UN Charter principles ‒ is fair and democratic, and globalisation plays a unifying role taking into account the interests of all the participants of international communication without exception, contributing to a stable and secure future for all humankind.","The emergence of new confident centres of economic power and associated political influence implies a new higher level of mutual trust, which is impossible to achieve without observing such fundamental principles of international life as the sovereignty of states, non-interference in their internal affairs, and the resolution of disputes by peaceful means.",It is necessary to agree on a uniform interpretation of the principles and norms of international law.,"In this connection, it is difficult to overestimate the importance of the UN, which enjoys universal legitimacy.",Recent practice has shown that joint actions backed by the authority of the UN in the form of relevant Security Council resolutions can lead to significant progress in resolving the most complex issues.,The attempts to adapt the institutions dating back to the era of bipolar confrontation to realities of the 21 st century are doomed to failure.,"In particular, the North Atlantic Alliance has remained part of the Cold War paradigm as it tries to find a reason for existence.","However, it was unable to provide a proper response to the growing main threat of modern times, which is terrorism.","Furthermore, NATO has destablised and continues to destabilise the security structure in Europe.","An outstanding statesman, diplomat, researcher and thinker, Mr Primakov has made a major contribution to the formulation of key provisions of Russia’s foreign policy doctrine, provisions that have passed the test of time.","This, without doubt, is at odds with the aspirations of the peoples of Europe.",International relations have reached an important fork.,Our choice will determine the way the world will look 15-20 years from now.,"Either we will continue to waste our time and resources, which is fraught with a new arms race, further expansion of the space of instability, chaos, and uncontrollability, or the leading centres of civilisation will manage to reach an agreement and unite their efforts based on broad international partnership with the central coordinating role of the UN.",Russia is clearly in favour of the latter.,We are invariably open to working with everyone who shows willingness to effectively address key issues of global development.,This our approach – in favour of collective multilateral efforts to strengthen security and establish broad-based equitable mutually beneficial cooperation – is shared by most members of the international community.,"Russia will continue to act in this vein and promote a peaceful, positive and forward-looking agenda in international affairs, and also act as a counterbalancing factor and a guarantor of global stability.","We will continue to build up cooperation with our partners in new associations such as the G20, BRICS, the SCO, the EAEU, and other associations in the CIS where there are no “leaders” or “followers,” and where decisions are made on the basis of a well-considered consensus with account taken of the interests of all the participants without exception.","Relations between Russia and the United States have a special role in the world, because a great many international issues, from strategic stability to regional crises, cannot be settled without them.","He also contributed to a comprehensive review of the complex processes underway in the post-bipolar world, which, as it turned out, do not fit the simplistic “end of history” logic.","We are aware of many countries’ concern about the souring of relations between our countries, which have been made hostage to political infighting in the United States.",We hope that the upcoming meeting between President Putin and President Trump in Hamburg will clarify the matter concerning the future of Russian-US relations.,"Personally, I hope that pragmatism and the resolve to use realistic and effective methods to protect national interests will prevail.","This is the approach that Henry Kissinger, an architect of the US foreign policy and a big friend of Yevgeny Primakov, has always used.",He is attending our forum today.,,,,,,Russia did its homework diligently in clearing up the Cold War debris and worked hard to build up confidence and mutual understanding in the Euro-Atlantic region and the rest of the world.,,,,,,,,,,,One of its biggest contributions was its decisive role in the reunification of Germany and the withdrawal of its troops from Central and Eastern Europe and the Baltic countries.,,,,,,,,,,,"We did this with our cards on the table, without a hidden agenda or double standards.",,,,,,,,,,It was largely thanks to the policy we pursued for

Association Agreement;,"Vladimir Putin’s recent visit to Ukraine to celebrate the anniversary of the christening of Kyiv Rus and Navy Day, showed that Russia’s President is concerned about the situation in Ukraine .","There is little time left before the presidential election and the launch of the Eurasian Union in 2015, as well as the looming prospect of the Association Agreement with the EU in November, which adds pressure. ","Notably, Putin only spoke to Yanukovych for 15 minutes, giving preference to Medvedchuk, the father of his goddaughter.",,It appears that Putin was forced to stoop so low as Medvedchuk’s Ukrainian Choice because there is no other alternative in Ukraine today.,"The failure of various Russian blocks and movements, and the collapse of the Church Russian World led by Patriarch Kirill that has been more and more evident of late, have left Putin with significantly less space and time to maneuver.","At the moment, he can only rely on the Communists who have zero prospects in Ukraine or the loyal Viktor Medvedchuk, a notorious Chief of Staff during the Kuchma presidency, and his Ukrainian Choice.","No matter what, Putin is no longer content with Yanukovych as his vassal in the gubernia that should be part of the Eurasian Union, since the latter seems to have realized the danger of closer integration with the Kremlin for his “estate”.","However, Yanukovych’s potential loss of power in 2015 is of even greater concern.","The Family realizes that following the Russian model is its only chance to rapidly build a business empire that is equal to, or larger than that of its friend Akhmetov.","Given the experience of the past three years, “Yanukovych’s Ukraine” is open to humanitarian expansion from the East, the inevitable russification of Ukraine’s cultural and media space, and the evolution of Ukraine’s socio-economic and socio-political models in line with the Russian mould.","But it will not cede its own interests, which are completely focused on the rapid expansion of its business empire, something that would be an integral part of Ukraine’s integration into the Kremlin’s neo-imperial projects.","Meanwhile, Putin has once again made it clear that he will not be content with just a loyal state – even a satellite.","Some experts in Ukraine assume that Putin’s new stance is to reinforce ideological influence and keep Ukraine in the Russian World , even if he has to let go of Kyiv in terms of trade and economics.","Instead, he seeks to completely eliminate the aftermaths of “the biggest geopolitical disaster of the 20 th century” – the collapse of the USSR and the emergence of an independent Ukraine.","Only people like Viktor Medvedchuk who is considered to have pushed Kuchma to consent to integration in the Common Economic Space at the end of his presidency in 2003, can liquidate this “abnormality” “which is not even a state” (as Putin put it in a conversation with George W.Bush in Bucharest in 2008).","So far, though, Medvedchuk seems to be too weak to affect 2015 developments in Ukraine, let alone seriously contribute to the disruption of the Association Agreement signing in November.",All this puts Moscow under time pressure.,"Indeed, the Association Agreement will not come into effect until ratified by all 28 EU member-states – and this could take years, especially if hampered by the Kremlin’s lobby in Europe.","However, the DCFTA as the economic part of the Association Agreement will come into effect immediately after signing and will be able to block Ukraine’s integration in the Customs and Eurasian Unions.","Therefore, there is every reason to expect a surprise or two from the Kremlin before the Vilnius Summit in November.",Similar things have occurred before when some events in foreign or internal policy threatened the Kremlin’s stability.,"For instance, a scandal similar to the alleged sale of Ukrainian Kolchuga ESM systems to Iraq that ruined Kuchma’s relations with the West at the dawn of Putin’s political career and his reintegration projects in the FSU.","Or a new wave of mudslinging against the Ukrainian government, this time bigger in terms of media coverage and with a stronger focus on Western politicians in order to ultimately convince the EU of the criminal nature of the Yanukovych regime and that the Association Agreement should not be signed with Ukraine. ",His messages in Ukraine are indeed generously flavoured with rhetoric about “unbreakable” blood and spiritual bonds.,"Meanwhile, projects like the Ukrainian Choice or media holdings created to spread the word on the Kremlin’s orders, are apparently created specifically for the 2015 presidential race.","They are probably supposed to expand the pro-Russian electorate in Ukraine, stealing it mainly from the former electorate of the Party of Regions and Yanukovych.","Ukrainian-Russian media are now fueling tension by presenting everything negatively, from the decisions and actions of the government, to social processes, trends and developments.",It’s possible that Putin is counting on a potential political vacuum in a number of southeastern regions that are currently under the total control of pro-Russian Regionaires.,"This is a likely scenario, if mass protests force Yanukovych to quit, as in the 2004 scenario, or if he loses the race to any of the pro-European opposition leaders.",Moscow already faced the huge risk of losing its influence over Ukraine for good in 2008 when the Ukrainian government applied for NATO’s Membership Action Plan .,"Apparently, it is preparing to respond to a similar threat after the 2015 election.",The risks for Ukraine in this situation are aggravated by the fact that the Yanukovych regime does not view it as a fully-fledged sovereign state and ignores national security.,"This is evident from the choice of appointments to law enforcement authorities and special services, where many generals who are openly pro-Russian, now serve.","Therefore, it will hardly be likely to develop an effective strategy to resist the possible special operations of Ukraine’s “strategic partner” as the Vilnius Summit and the presidential election draw closer.","He mentioned this at the Russian and Ukrainian Navy parade in Sevastopol, which he visited with Viktor Yanukovych, referring to the “strength of and devotion to the fundamentals of our predecessors who lived, worked and protected their common Motherland together for centuries and made it powerful, great and undefeated…",Ukraine as a state is only valuable to the Family if it maintains power.,This is why the regime will not develop any preventive measures for external scenarios that could hurt the country.," It appears that Yanukovych still believes that the loss of power in 2004 was a coincidence, a lack of preparedness for extreme scenarios and the betrayal of Kuchma.","Therefore, he may be confident of his ability to keep everything under control in 2015.","For this reason, the government is instead developing preventive measures to internal threats, by trying to curb protest movements and appointing loyal people to offices which have a direct influence on the outcome of the presidential election.","Meanwhile, it is turning a blind eye to external threats.","It looks like Putin and pro-Russian forces in Ukraine, including those inside the Party of Regions, are preparing to use Yanukovych’s limitations and shortsightedness for their own benefit. ",,,,"We share common roots, culture and
