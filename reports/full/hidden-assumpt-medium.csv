Association Agreement;,Experts say there's motivation beyond altruism for the US and EU trying to forge closer ties with the country in crisis,"As the crisis in Ukraine  drags on into its fourth month, the geopolitics of the situation have grown increasingly complex, with more diplomats, leaders and interested parties opining on each and every development in the country.","Ukraine is also one of the world’s largest growers of corn and wheat, and exports it to EU countries and elsewhere.","Analysts believe that with heavy investment, Ukraine’s agricultural sector could grow exponentially. ","Beyond maintaining the current flow of trade, if Ukraine shuns Russia, experts believe EU countries will be able to benefit from increased trade with Ukraine.",That’s why EU officials are attempting to sign a  free-trade agreement with Ukraine  even as the crisis escalates.,And some say the country may even be able to eventually join the European Union.,"But more important than crops and cars — for Ukraine, the EU and U.S. — is gas.","Experts say the EU and U.S. could profit economically if Ukraine begins to rely less on Gazprom, Russia’s quasi-governmental oil and gas giant. ",They point out that the protests in Ukraine started partially because of Ukraine’s  near-complete reliance on Russian gas.,And Ukraine has been trying to break away from that dependence for years.,"In November, it signed a $10 billion deal with Chevron to produce natural gas within Ukraine, but it could also look elsewhere for its supplies.","President Barack Obama and leaders from the European Union, for example, have spoken at length on what they want for Ukraine — that it determine its own destiny, and not just any destiny, but one that is different from its past of playing economic lapdog to Russia.","As the EU and U.S. discover new ways to extract oil and gas on their own soil — namely through hydraulic fracturing — and build liquefied natural-gas terminals to send it around the world, Ukraine could become a viable market.","“The whole natural gas market is changing dramatically,” USIP’s Taylor said.","“Over the next five years, there’s going to be dramatic changes in the flows of gas, and the leverage Russians have over the EU and Ukraine is going to decline.”  ","Because Europe also relies heavily on Gazprom, disrupting Ukraine’s relations with Russia is a risky prospect.","Some believe it’s no coincidence that the countries that rely most on Russia for gas, especially Germany,  have been more reluctant  than the U.S. to suggest
